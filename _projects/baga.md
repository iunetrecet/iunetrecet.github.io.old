I wanted to make a bag for my sister, with the lyrics of a very special basque song.

I bought a thread fabric, cut and sewed it. Then, I designed the lyrics using many fonts giving a funny and modern style. Finally, I went to the serigraph workshop and I made the serigraph in the bag.

I made more than twenty bags, because many people asked me if they could buy it.
