I wanted to make a bag for my sister, with the lyric of a special basque song.

I bought a thread fabric, cut and sewed it. Then, I designed the lyric wit many fonts giving a funny and modern style. Finally, I went to the serigraph workshop and I made the serigraph in the bag.

I made more than twenty bags, because many people ask me to buy it.
