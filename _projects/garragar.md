Image of a little beer brewery and the bottles of beer.

The name Garragar is a mix between garagar, beer in Basque and Garraus, the
surname of the brewery owner and in the same time, gar in Basque is flame.

I wanted to make a image in accordance with the owner of the brewery, a modern
elegant and hard-worker. The design reflects the personality of the owner, and in addition, I could not forget the flame. The flame gives to the beer the risk and provocative image.
