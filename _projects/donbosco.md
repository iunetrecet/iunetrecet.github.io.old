Don Bosco Ibilaldia, a rally of classic cars, made a competition for their poster.

The poster presented by me was chosen for the top ten, and exposed at the end of the rally.

For the design of the poster I decided to make a tribute to the Seat 600, a spanish icon from the 60s. It is all colorful and flashy, like the cars and the period itself.
