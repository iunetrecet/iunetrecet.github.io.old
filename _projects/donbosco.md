Don Bosco Ibilaldia,  a rally of classic cars, made a competition for the publishing poster.

The poster presented by me was chosen for the top ten, and exposed at the finish of the rally.

For the design of the poster, I decided to make a tribute to the Seat 600, a spanish 60s icon. It is a colorful and flashy, like the cars and the period.
