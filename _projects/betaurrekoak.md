The aim of the projects was making a poster of a known sun glasses mark. I
shared this project with other classmates, however, the idea was mine.

While I was thinking on the project I looked at my group colleague and the idea
came naturally: "The sun glasses are so poweful that while a caucasian person's
skin looks like african, the eyes keep being like before".
