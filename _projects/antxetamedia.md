Antxeta Irratia is a community radio from the Bidasoa valley.

Antxeta Irratia decided to make a new website because they used to have a blog but now have too much information.

This was my first project as web designer and it was a very big challenge for me. There was a lot information on the first page, but it had to be very neat. I though to make a third column page for a better distribution of the content. It has sober colors to give importance to the images and clean readability for the content.
