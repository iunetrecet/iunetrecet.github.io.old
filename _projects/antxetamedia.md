Antxeta Irratia is a community radio from Bidasoa valley.

Antxeta Irratia decided to make a new web because used to have a blog, and they have too much information for having only a blog.

This was my first project as web designer and it was a very big challenge for me. There was a lot information for the first page, but it had to be very neat. I though to make a third column page for a better distribution of the content. It has sober colors to give the importance to the images of the content and a clean reading of the information.
