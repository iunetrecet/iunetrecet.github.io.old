This is one of the hardest project I have ever made, however, is the more
beautiful.

Before coming to Glasgow, I wanted to give a present to all the people that is
important in my life. I had this project in mind and I thought that was the best
moment to carry out.

The village is Pasai Donibane, although is the most lovely village in the Basque coast, the
fact that my father and all my family is from this village was the most
important condition to make it.
